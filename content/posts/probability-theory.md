- event A
  - probability of event A occuring P(A)
- random variable X
  - probability distribution for random variable X
  - probability density function for X
  - expectation and variance of X
- $P(sure envent) = 1$
- $P(impossible event) = 0$
- $P(A) + P(\neg{A}) = 1$, complementary events
- $P(A \vee B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A \wedge B)$ 
  - A, B are exclusive events: $P(A \wedge B) = 0 \implies P(A \vee B) = P(A) + P(B)$
- $A\sube B \implies P(A) \leq P(B)$
- $A_1, A_2, ..., A_n$ are elementary events $\implies \displaystyle\sum_{i=0}^n P(A_i) = 1$
